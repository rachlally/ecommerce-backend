# eCommerce Back End
The back end of an e-commerce site

## Description

This program uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a Mysql database to explore what the back end of an e-commerce site might look like.  Having a program like this in place for a business is important.  Business owners need access to information like their products and categories for sale and inventory purposes.

By creating this program, I learned how to use Sequelize to create the database models.  I learned how to use Express.js to create routes so a user can GET information from their database or POST, PUT, or DELETE items.

## Installation

To install, download this repo to your local machine.  Download required packages (npm i): express, mysql, sequelize, and dotenv.  Save your Mysql password to the `.env` file.  Login to Mysql.  Run schema.sql.  Then, npm run seed.

## Usage

For a video demo: 

Though not a deployed site, a user may use a program such as Insomnia to see avaliable routes for finding, adding, updating, and deleting tables within the database.

## Credits

Big round of applause to my instructor, TAs, and tutors for all their help.
